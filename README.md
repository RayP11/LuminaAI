# Lumina AI
Optimized for College Students
Lumina AI is a local, privacy-focused AI assistant designed specifically for college students. It leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model powered by LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) to provide intelligent, context-aware responses and insights based on user-submitted documents. Additionally, Lumina AI includes a database AI agent that analyzes, summarizes, and connects documents, making it an invaluable tool for research, summarization, projects, and other school work.

# Libraries
- Created using Langchain - ollama - Chroma
- Check requirements.txt for full library usage

# Next Steps
Optimization - The next step is to optimize a llama model through training it on various research documents

# Other Uses
While this Software will be optimized for students, it can easily be optimized for other industries or research such as:
- education (teachers)
- businesses (business documents/information)
- students (help with research and summarizing info)
- engineering (taking in notes, diagrams, or blueprints)
- programming (Utilize user-given documents to write code with context from entire files)
- Speech (Translating entire documents into other languages)
